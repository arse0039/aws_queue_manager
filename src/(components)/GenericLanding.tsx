            <p>Welcome to the Queue Manager!</p>
            <p>After spending nearly two years working as a TA at Oregon State University, I often struggled with managing
                the queue of students using just Microsoft Teams. Keeping up with the order and how long students had been in 
                the queue was challenging during busy office hour times. This app exists to help TA's and instuctors more easily
                manage office hour queues.
